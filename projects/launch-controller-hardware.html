          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            SARP needed a new generation of launch controller hardware to support expanded functionality and a more reliable design. The previous controller had limitations in the relay and signal pathways needed for the team's evolving launch operations, and the hardware itself needed to be purpose-built and validated from scratch. That meant someone had to take on the full bring-up: reading PCB schematics, soldering SMD and through-hole components, verifying power paths, and debugging Raspberry Pi connectivity until everything was stable under real operating conditions. I took this on as the responsible engineer.

            <li>Assembled and soldered two complete launch controller boards, covering SMD and through-hole parts across the controller, buck converter, and relay assemblies.</li>
            <li>Troubleshot power, connectivity, and boot issues on Raspberry Pi systems with a bench supply and multimeter, verifying voltage inputs, current draw, and overall board performance.</li>
            <li>Interpreted PCB designs and schematics to correctly install polarized components and maintain signal integrity.</li>
            <li>Tested circuits end-to-end using a controlled power supply, validating voltage inputs and stability under expected loads.</li>
            <li>Led a small team, delegating tasks and coordinating checkpoints to keep project milestones on track.</li>

          <h2>The Outcome</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Two fully assembled and validated launch controller boards were delivered on time for integration with the ground systems stack. Power paths, relay assemblies, and Raspberry Pi connectivity were all verified stable under expected loads, giving the team a reliable hardware foundation with the expanded functionality needed for upcoming test campaigns.
