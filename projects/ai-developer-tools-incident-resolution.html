          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Two separate but related inefficiencies were slowing the team down. First, GitHub Copilot was nearly unusable in our codebase — the repo was so large that the AI would spend up to 20 minutes just orienting itself before producing hallucinated or incorrect implementations, leaving developers to spend more time cleaning up after it than they saved. Second, engineers resolving "Shield" incidents (user-reported Outlook issues) had to manually download incident files, navigate across multiple apps and data sources, and manually piece together context just to arrive at a solution — often an incomplete one given the fragmented information available.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
          <h2>What I Did</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Automated customer incident resolution by developing 2 specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that enable AI assistants to autonomously navigate hierarchical data structures and extract relevant information from user reports, saving 10-20 minutes per incident and eliminating need for manual developer intervention in support workflows.</li>
            <li>Accelerated development processes from 30 minutes to 5 seconds by implementing 15+ automated boilerplate code generation MCP tools for core software components, while ensuring consistent coding patterns and standards across enterprise codebase.</li>
            <li>Eliminated AI processing bottlenecks by developing 3 MCP investigation tools that enable AI agents to efficiently parse complex object definitions without reading 10,000+ line files, reducing analysis time from minutes to seconds.</li>
            <li>Built context-aware AI guidance system using 9 specialized MCP instruction guides that automatically activate based on task context, enabling AI assistants to provide expert-level guidance for complex software engineering workflows without manual knowledge lookup.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
          <h2>The Outcome</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            AI assistants could navigate the codebase in seconds rather than minutes, and incident triage no longer required engineers to manually gather context across multiple tools. Shield incident resolution went from a fragmented, multi-step process to an AI-assisted workflow, saving 10–20 minutes per incident. Boilerplate generation that previously took ~30 minutes was reduced to 5 seconds, and the guidance system meant AI had the right context automatically — no manual knowledge lookup required.
