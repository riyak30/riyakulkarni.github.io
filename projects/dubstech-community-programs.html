          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Scaling a student tech organization without a clear strategy means events become inconsistent, partnerships lapse, and community momentum stalls. DubsTech also had a mission gap to address: UW students lacked structured pathways to earn real certifications and hands-on experience with industry tools, while students in underserved Seattle schools had little to no exposure to STEM careers. Growing the organization meant solving both the internal execution challenge and the external impact one at the same time.

          <h2>What I Did</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Set org strategy as Co-President, delegating initiatives and driving execution across events, partnerships, and community engagement.</li>
            <li>Coordinated weekly leadership meetings to align priorities, track progress, and ensure accountability.</li>
            <li>Oversaw large-scale technical events and initiatives, including hackathons and workshops.</li>
            <li>Recruited and managed new team members, building a high-performing leadership group aligned to mission and culture.</li>
            <li>Directed 7 hackathons (~600 participants), organized panels with 30+ industry experts, and ran STEM outreach programs for under-resourced Seattle schools.</li>
            <li>Delivered workshops that enabled attendees to earn certifications in tools like Power BI and Tableau.</li>
            <li>Ensured all events were open to the public — not just UW students — so that participants from underprivileged schools could attend hackathons, build real projects, and add meaningful work to their resumes.</li>
            <li>Provided students from underserved communities access to industry professionals, hands-on technical experience, and resume-worthy accomplishments they otherwise wouldn't have had a pathway to.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Outcome</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            DubsTech scaled under consistent strategic direction across my tenure. Seven hackathons ran with roughly 600 participants, 30+ industry professionals connected with students through panels and workshops, and STEM programming reached schools in underserved Seattle communities. Workshops produced real, verifiable outcomes: attendees earned industry certifications in tools like Power BI and Tableau, walking away with credentials they could put on a resume.
