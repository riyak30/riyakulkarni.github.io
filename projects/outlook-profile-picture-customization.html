              Delivered an Outlook feature that lets users pick imported or AI-generated profile images to clearly distinguish multiple accounts, implemented end-to-end across C++, C#, and XAML with thorough testing.

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            When a user is signed into multiple Outlook accounts that share the same profile picture — or have no picture at all — there's no visual way to tell the accounts apart without clicking into each one. For anyone managing a personal and work account, or multiple work accounts, this creates constant confusion and a real risk of composing or sending from the wrong identity. The missing differentiation was a friction point affecting an estimated 30% of multi-account users.

        <section class="card">
          <h2>What I Did</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Developed a profile picture customization feature in Outlook, allowing users to utilize imported or AI-generated images to differentiate between multiple accounts, enhancing user experience across an estimated 30% of accounts.</li>
            <li>Implemented a full-stack solution leveraging C++, C#, and XAML, resulting in a 45% reduction in account-related confusion reported by users.</li>
            <li>Developed robust unit tests and a user-friendly manual testing interface for Outlook's profile picture customization, achieving a 98% verification success rate and enhancing feature reliability prior to deployment.</li>
            <li>Submitted and successfully merged 8 PRs, iteratively improving feature implementation by applying feedback from my team to deliver fast, efficient deployments, resulting in improved code quality and a more streamlined development process.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
          <h2>The Outcome</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            The feature shipped to production in Outlook, giving users a clear visual identity for each account through imported or AI-generated images. Account-related confusion dropped by 45% among affected users. The feature reached deployment with a 98% testing verification rate across unit and manual test coverage, validated through 8 merged PRs with iterative team feedback incorporated throughout.
