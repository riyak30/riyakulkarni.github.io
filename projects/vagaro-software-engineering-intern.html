              Designed and deployed a self-help portal within Vagaro's Call Center platform to resolve agent timeline issues autonomously, eliminating Software Team intervention and increasing efficiency by 83%.

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Call center agents regularly ran into issues with their time logs. To fix one, an agent had to locate the specific log ID and pass it to a software developer, who would then manually scroll through MongoDB, find the record, and update it by hand — a process that could easily consume an hour of a developer's day. This created a painful bottleneck: agents were blocked on their work, and engineers were pulled away from their actual sprint work to perform manual data corrections on demand.

          <h2>What I Did</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Designed and deployed a self-help portal within Vagaro's Call Center platform to autonomously resolve agent timeline issues, eliminating the need for Software Team intervention and increasing efficiency by 83%.</li>
            <li>Implemented a full-stack solution using JavaScript, C#, and MongoDB to create the self-help portal, leading to seven hours per week time-saving across two teams.</li>
            <li>Integrated the self-help portal into Vagaro's continuous deployment infrastructure using Jenkins and Docker Desktop to ensure daily deployments and no-downtime updates.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
          <h2>The Outcome</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Agents could resolve their own timeline issues directly in the portal without ever involving a developer. The software team reclaimed roughly seven hours per week, and overall efficiency improved by 83%. Because the portal was integrated into the existing CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Docker, it shipped with daily deployments and zero downtime — no special release process required.
